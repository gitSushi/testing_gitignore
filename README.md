# Testing gitignore

.gitignore gave me some grief the other day.
So this is practice !

## My Findings

(working on VSCode)

As I save this .gitignore file with my testing_commands.txt(the file I want to be ignored) in it,
its reference in the explorer changes to a darker gray

if I comment it out
it turns light gray

## After thought

Now that I know exactly how it works I'll just have to check my other project.

Practice makes Perfect !!!
